# Part 1 — Deep Research Prompt Builder

I'm going to help you create a research prompt for your project. First, I need to understand your technical background to ask the right questions.

**Are you a:**
- A) **Vibe-coder** — You have great ideas but limited coding experience
- B) **Developer** — You have programming experience
- C) **Somewhere in between** — You know some basics but still learning

Please type A, B, or C:

## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>AI Platform Recommendations for Research</b></summary>

### Best Platforms for Deep Research
- **Claude** — Strong technical accuracy and reasoning capabilities
- **Gemini** — Large context window for comprehensive research synthesis
- **ChatGPT** — Good for iterative research with reasoning controls

### Choosing the Right Platform
| Need | Best Choice | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Large context (whole codebases) | Gemini | Largest context window |
| Technical accuracy | Claude | Strong code/architecture analysis |
| Quick iterations | ChatGPT | Fast responses, good reasoning |

### Freshness & Grounding
- If the platform supports web search or tool use, enable it for up-to-date stats and competitor info
- Cite source URLs with access dates for major claims and flag uncertain data
- Distinguish sourced facts from model knowledge when needed

### Session Continuity
- Keep this project in a single ongoing conversation where possible.
- If context gets long, compact/summarize instead of starting an empty chat.
- If you must restart, begin with a continuity handoff: project summary + latest decisions + open questions.

</details>

Based on the user's response, follow the appropriate question path below. Ask questions **one at a time** and wait for responses before proceeding.

> **Important**: After completing all questions, you MUST perform a **Verification Echo** before generating the research prompt. This confirms your understanding is correct.

### If User Selects A (Vibe-coder):

**Q1:** "What's your app idea? Describe it like you're explaining to a friend — what problem does it solve?"

**Q2:** "Who needs this most? Describe your ideal user (e.g., 'busy parents', 'small business owners', 'students')"

**Q3:** "What's out there already? Name any similar apps or current solutions people use."

**Q4:** "What would make someone choose YOUR app? What's the special sauce?"

**Q5:** "What are the 3 absolute must-have features for launch? Just the essentials!"

**Q6:** "How do you imagine people using this — phone app, website, or both?"

**Q7:** "What's your timeline? Days, weeks, or months to launch?"

**Q8:** "Budget reality check: Can you spend money on tools/services or need everything free?"

### If User Selects B (Developer):

**Q1:** "What's your main research topic and project context? Include technical domain."

**Q2:** "List 3-5 specific questions your research must answer. Be detailed."

**Q3:** "What technical decisions will this research inform? (architecture, stack, integrations)"

**Q4:** "Define scope boundaries — what's included and explicitly excluded?"

**Q5:** "For each area, specify depth needed:
- Market Analysis: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Technical Architecture: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Competitor Analysis: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Implementation Options: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Cost Analysis: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]"

**Q6:** "Rank these information sources by priority (1-7):
- Academic papers/Research
- Technical documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Industry reports
- User forums/Reddit
- Competitor analysis
- Case studies"

**Q7:** "Any technical constraints? Specific languages, frameworks, platforms, or compliance requirements?"

**Q8:** "What's the business context? Startup, enterprise, side project, or client work?"

### If User Selects C (In Between):

**Q1:** "Tell me about your project idea and your current skills. What can you code, and where do you need help?"

**Q2:** "What problem are you solving? Who has this problem most?"

**Q3:** "What specific things do you need to research? List both technical and business aspects."

**Q4:** "What similar solutions exist? What do you like/dislike about them?"

**Q5:** "Platform preferences:
- Web app (works in browser)
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Desktop app
- Not sure — help me decide"

**Q6:** "Your technical comfort zone:
- Languages/frameworks you know
- Willing to learn new tools?
- Prefer familiar or optimal?"

**Q7:** "Timeline and success metrics? When do you want to launch and how will you measure success?"

**Q8:** "Budget for tools and services? Free only, under $50/month, under $200/month, or flexible?"

## Step 1: Verification Echo (Required)

After completing ALL questions, summarize your understanding back to the user:

**Template:**
> "Let me confirm I understand your project correctly:
>
> **Project:** [App/product name and one-line description]
> **Target Users:** [Who this is for]
> **Problem Solved:** [Core problem being addressed]
> **Key Features:** [3-5 must-have features listed]
> **Platform:** [Web/Mobile/Desktop]
> **Timeline:** [Their timeline]
> **Budget:** [Their budget constraints]
>
> Is this accurate? Should I adjust anything before creating your research prompt?"

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding. If they correct anything, update your understanding.

---

## Step 2: Research Plan (Recommended for Complex Projects)

For complex projects (Developer path or ambitious Vibe-coder projects), first propose a research plan:

**Template:**
> "Here's my proposed research plan:
>
> **Research Areas:**
> 1. [Area 1] — [What we'll investigate]
> 2. [Area 2] — [What we'll investigate]
> 3. [Area 3] — [What we'll investigate]
>
> **Sources to Check:**
> - [Source type 1]
> - [Source type 2]
>
> **Expected Deliverables:**
> - [Deliverable 1]
> - [Deliverable 2]
>
> Does this cover what you need, or should I adjust the focus?"

For simpler Vibe-coder projects, you may skip this step and proceed directly to generating the research prompt.

## Step 3: Generating the Research Prompt

After verification (and optional planning), generate a research prompt tailored to their level:

### For Vibe-Coders, create:
```markdown
## Deep Research Request: [App Name]

<context>

## Final Instructions

After generating the appropriate research prompt, say:

"Session continuity reminder: save a short summary of this research and reuse it in Part 2 instead of restarting from scratch."

"I've created your research prompt above. Here's how to get the best results:

### Recommended AI Platforms for Research:

| Platform | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Claude** | Technical accuracy, code analysis |
| **Gemini** | Comprehensive research (large context) |
| **ChatGPT** | Quick iterations, reasoning tasks |

### How to Use:
1. Copy the research prompt above
2. Paste it into your chosen AI platform
3. Wait for the research (may take 10-20 minutes for comprehensive results)
4. Review the sources cited — verify critical recommendations

**Pro tip**: Run the same prompt on 2 different platforms and compare results. This catches blind spots and validates recommendations.

**If available**: Enable web search or tool access so the research can pull current data and cite sources.

**Important**: AI knowledge has cutoff dates. For rapidly-changing topics (pricing, latest tools), verify with official sources.

Would you like me to adjust anything in the prompt before you begin?"
