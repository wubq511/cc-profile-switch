# Part 3 — Technical Design Document Generator

I'll help you create a Technical Design Document for your MVP. This document will define HOW to build what you outlined in your PRD using modern tools and best practices.

<details>
<summary><b>Before We Start — Required Documents</b></summary>

### Required Files:
1. **PRD Document** (from Part 2) — Required
2. **Research Findings** (from Part 1) — Optional but helpful

Please attach these as:
- `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.md` files
- Or paste the content directly if short

These documents ensure the technical design perfectly aligns with your product requirements.

</details>

Once you've attached the file(s), please confirm your technical level:
- A) **Vibe-coder** — Limited coding, using AI to build everything
- B) **Developer** — Experienced programmer
- C) **Somewhere in between** — Some basics, still learning

Please attach your PRD (and optionally your research) and type A, B, or C:

## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>Best AI Platforms for Technical Design</b></summary>

### Recommended Platforms
- **Claude** — Strong architecture reasoning and consistent technical documentation
- **Gemini** — Handles complex trade-off analysis with large context
- **ChatGPT** — Fast technical iteration with good reasoning capabilities

### Choosing the Right Platform
| Need | Best Choice | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Architecture design | Claude | Strong at system thinking |
| Trade-off analysis | Gemini | Large context for comparisons |
| Quick iteration | ChatGPT | Fast responses |

**Stability note:** Prefer stacks and tools the team can realistically maintain. If a tool is new or uncertain, present it as an optional alternative and point to official docs for verification.

**Continuity note:** Keep technical design in the same project conversation where possible. If the session gets too long, summarize/compact instead of opening an empty thread.

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- [Core entity from PRD]
CREATE TABLE [entity_name] (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    [fields based on PRD],
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_[entity]_user_id ON [entity](user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_[entity]_created_at ON [entity](created_at);
```

## Feature Implementation

### Feature 1: [From PRD]

#### API Design
```text
// Endpoint definitions (pseudocode — replace FEATURE with your actual feature name)
POST   /api/FEATURE          // Create
GET    /api/FEATURE          // List
GET    /api/FEATURE/:id      // Get one
PUT    /api/FEATURE/:id      // Update
DELETE /api/FEATURE/:id      // Delete
```

```typescript
// Request/Response types (replace Feature with your actual feature name, e.g. Task, Project)
interface CreateFeatureRequest {
  // fields from PRD
}

interface FeatureResponse {
  id: string;
  // fields from PRD
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Business Logic
```typescript
// Service class (replace Feature with your actual feature name)
class FeatureService {
  async create(data: CreateFeatureRequest): Promise<FeatureResponse> {
    // Validation
    // Business rules
    // Persistence
    // Event emission
  }

  async findAll(filters: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<FeatureResponse[]> {
    // Query building
    // Pagination
    // Caching strategy
  }
}
```

[Repeat for each PRD feature]

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
interface AuthStrategy {
  provider: 'local' | 'oauth';
  tokenExpiry: '1h';
  refreshExpiry: '7d';
  mfa: boolean;
}

// RBAC implementation
enum Role {
  USER = 'user',
  ADMIN = 'admin'
}

// Middleware
authenticate() -> validates JWT
authorize(role) -> checks permissions
rateLimiter() -> prevents abuse
```

### Security Headers
```javascript
// Helmet.js configuration
{
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Browser Cache:** Static assets (1 year)
- **CDN Cache:** Images/media (CloudFront/Cloudflare)
- **Application Cache:** Redis for sessions/hot data
- **Database Cache:** Query result caching

### Optimization Techniques
```javascript
// Code splitting (Next.js)
const Feature = dynamic(() => import('./Feature'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton />,
  ssr: false
});

// Database query optimization
// Use indexes, limit projections, paginate
const results = await db.query({
  select: ['id', 'name'], // Only needed fields
  where: { indexed_field: value },
  limit: 20,
  offset: page * 20
});
```

## Development Workflow

### AI-Assisted Development Strategy

| Phase | Primary Tool | Secondary Tool | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Architecture | Claude | ChatGPT | System design |
| Implementation | Cursor | GitHub Copilot | Code generation |
| Debugging | Claude Code | ChatGPT | Problem solving |
| Testing | GitHub Copilot | Claude | Test generation |
| Documentation | ChatGPT | Claude | Docs writing |

### Git Workflow
```bash
main
├── develop
│   ├── feature/[feature-name]
│   ├── fix/[bug-fix]
│   └── chore/[maintenance]
└── release/[version]
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks
- Run format/lint/tests before commit
- Use git hooks or a hook manager appropriate for your stack
- Update hooks as the project scales

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - run: npm ci --production
      - uses: [deploy-action]
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Targets
- Unit Tests: 80% coverage
- Integration Tests: Critical paths
- E2E Tests: Main user journeys

### Testing Stack
```javascript
// Unit testing
describe('FeatureService', () => {
  it('should create feature', async () => {
    const result = await service.create(mockData);
    expect(result).toMatchObject(expected);
  });
});

// E2E testing (Playwright)
test('user can complete main flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('[data-testid=start]');
  // ... test steps
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/success');
});
```

### Visual Verification Loop
UI changes should use a Generate-Render-Inspect-Refine cycle:
1. **Generate:** AI produces component code
2. **Render:** Preview in dev server or headless browser
3. **Inspect:** Screenshot capture + design principle check
4. **Refine:** Fix visual regressions before committing

### Self-Healing Test Pattern
When Playwright tests fail, capture context for auto-repair:
```javascript
// Capture failure context for AI repair
const failureContext = {
  error: error.message,
  codeSnippet: testCode,
  ariaSnapshot: await page.accessibility.snapshot()
};
// AI prompt: "Fix selector using getByRole or getByText"
```

## Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code
```terraform
# main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_service" "app" {
  name            = var.app_name
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.app.arn
  desired_count   = var.app_count

  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_alb_target_group.app.arn
    container_name   = var.app_name
    container_port   = var.app_port
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
JWT_SECRET=...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
SENTRY_DSN=...
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- **Application:** Response time, error rate, throughput
- **Business:** User signups, feature adoption, retention
- **Infrastructure:** CPU, memory, disk, network

### Logging Strategy
```typescript
// Structured logging with Pino
logger.info({
  event: 'user_action',
  userId: user.id,
  action: 'feature_used',
  metadata: { feature: 'name', duration: 123 }
});
```

## Cost Analysis

> **Note:** Verify all pricing directly with each vendor before budgeting. Tiers and costs change frequently. Last verified: 2026-04.

### Running Costs (Monthly — example stack, verify current pricing)
| Service | Example Tier | Verify at |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Hosting (Vercel) | Pro | vercel.com/pricing |
| Database (Supabase) | Pro | supabase.com/pricing |
| Redis (Upstash) | Pay-as-you-go | upstash.com/pricing |
| Monitoring (Sentry) | Team | sentry.io/pricing |
| Email (Resend) | Pro | resend.com/pricing |
| **Total** | | **Check current vendor pages** |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scaling issues | Medium | High | Use serverless, add caching early |
| Security breach | Low | Critical | Regular audits, dependency updates |
| Cost overrun | Medium | Medium | Set up billing alerts, use free tiers |
| Technical debt | High | Medium | Regular refactoring sprints |

## Migration & Scaling Path

### Phase 1: MVP (0-1K users)
- Current architecture handles well
- Monitor performance metrics
- Gather user feedback

### Phase 2: Growth (1K-10K users)
- Add Redis caching layer
- Implement CDN for assets
- Database read replicas

### Phase 3: Scale (10K+ users)
- Microservices migration
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced monitoring

## Maintainability & Update Cadence
- Prefer stable dependencies; avoid unnecessary churn
- Review release notes regularly and adjust when needed
- Update AGENTS.md, agent_docs, and hook/CI commands as the project scales

## Agent Architecture (Advanced)

### Planner-Executor-Reviewer (PER) Loop
For complex features, structure AI interactions as:
1. **Planner:** Decompose feature into task dependency graph
2. **Executor:** Implement single isolated tasks with tools
3. **Reviewer:** Validate output against acceptance criteria

### MCP Integration Points
Consider adding relevant MCP servers for enhanced AI capabilities:
- **Database MCP:** Secure schema discovery and read-only queries

## Simplified Architecture

### How Your App Works

```
User clicks button → Frontend sends request → Backend processes → Database saves → Frontend updates

Specifically:
1. User Action (React component)
2. API Call (fetch or Supabase client)
3. Backend Logic (Supabase functions)
4. Database Operation (PostgreSQL)
5. Response (JSON data)
6. UI Update (React re-render)
```

### Key Concepts to Understand

1. **Components:** Reusable pieces of UI
   - Think: LEGO blocks for interfaces

2. **State:** Data that changes
   - Think: Variables that update the screen

3. **Props:** Data passed to components
   - Think: Settings for your LEGO blocks

4. **Hooks:** React features
   - Think: Special functions starting with 'use'

## AI Feature Integration (Optional)

If your MVP includes AI features, define:
- **Use cases:** [Chat, summarization, recommendations]
- **Provider options:** [API-based vs local models]
- **Data sensitivity:** [Public/Private/PII]
- **Latency/cost targets:** [Constraints]
- **Fallback behavior:** [What happens on failure]
