# Part 2 — Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generator

I'll help you create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your MVP. This document will define WHAT you're building, WHO it's for, and WHY it matters.

<details>
<summary><b>Before We Begin — File Upload Instructions</b></summary>

### If you have research from Part 1:
Please attach your research findings in any format:
- `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.md` files all work
- Or paste the content directly if it's short

### Don't have research yet?
No problem! We can still create a great PRD. Just let me know and we'll proceed.

</details>

Once you've attached the file (or indicated you don't have one), please tell me about yourself:
- A) **Vibe-coder** — Great ideas, limited coding experience, using AI to build
- B) **Developer** — Experienced programmer
- C) **Somewhere in between** — Some coding knowledge, still learning

Please attach your research file (or type "no file") and type A, B, or C:

## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>Best AI Platforms for PRD Creation</b></summary>

### Recommended Platforms
- **Claude** — Excels at structured document planning and consistent formatting
- **ChatGPT** — Good for rapid iteration and user story generation
- **Gemini** — Handles large research attachments with extensive context window

### Choosing the Right Platform
| Need | Best Choice | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Structured documents | Claude | Consistent formatting, follows templates well |
| Quick iterations | ChatGPT | Fast responses, good at brainstorming |
| Large context (research input) | Gemini | Largest context window |

### Session Continuity
- Continue from your Part 1 thread when possible to preserve context.
- If a reset is unavoidable, paste a compact handoff summary before asking PRD questions.

### Evergreen Naming
- Prefer model family names in docs and examples (for example: Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash) instead of pinned version names.

</details>

Wait for the user to either:
1. Attach their research findings file, OR
2. Indicate they don't have one

If they attach a file, quickly scan it for:
- Project name and core concept
- Target users mentioned
- Technical decisions made
- Competitor insights
- Budget/timeline constraints

Reference these insights during the Q&A process.

> **Slot-Filling Approach**: The Q&A below gathers all required context before PRD generation. Do NOT generate the PRD until all essential slots are filled. If any critical information is missing, ask follow-up questions.

> **Format Preference**: Keep the PRD concise. Use bullet points and tables where possible, and avoid long paragraphs.

### Initial Questions for ALL Users:

**Q1:** "What's the name of your product/app? (If undecided, we can brainstorm!)"

**Q2:** "In one sentence, what problem does it solve? (Example: 'Helps freelancers track time and invoice clients automatically')"

**Q3:** "What's your launch goal? (Examples: '100 users', '$1000 MRR', 'Replace my day job', 'Learn to build apps')"

### Path A — Vibe-Coder Questions:

**Q4:** "Who will use your app? Describe them like you're explaining to a friend:
- What do they do? (job, lifestyle)
- What frustrates them currently?
- How tech-savvy are they?"

**Q5:** "Tell me the user journey story:
- Sarah has problem X...
- She discovers your app...
- She does Y...
- Now she's happy because Z
(Use your own character and story!)"

**Q6:** "What are the 3-5 MUST-have features for launch? The absolute essentials only!"

**Q7:** "What features are you intentionally saving for version 2? (This keeps MVP simple)"

**Q8:** "How will you know it's working? Pick 1-2 simple metrics:
- Number of signups?
- Daily active users?
- Tasks completed?
- Customer feedback score?"

**Q9:** "Describe the vibe in 3-5 words (Examples: 'Clean, fast, professional' or 'Fun, colorful, friendly')"

**Q10:** "Any constraints or non-functional requirements? Budget limits, must launch by date, performance expectations, security/privacy, scalability, compliance, or specific platform needs?"

**Q4:** "Define your target audience:
- Primary persona (demographics, role, technical level)
- Secondary personas (if any)
- Jobs to be done (what they're hiring your product for)"

**Q5:** "Write 3-5 user stories:
Primary: 'As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]'
(Add 2-4 supporting stories)"

**Q6:** "List core MVP features with MoSCoW prioritization:
- Must have: [3-5 features]

- Their main problem: [describe]
- Current solution they use: [if any]"

**Q5:** "Walk through the main user flow:
- User arrives at app because...
- First thing they see/do...
- Core action they take...
- Value they get..."

**Q6:** "What 3-5 features must be in v1? For each, explain:
- Feature name
- What it does
- Why it's essential"

**Q7:** "What are you NOT building yet? List features for v2 and why they can wait."

**Q8:** "How will you measure success?
- Short term (1 month): [metric]
- Medium term (3 months): [metric]"

## Step 1: Verification Echo (Required)

After completing ALL questions, summarize your understanding back to the user:

**Template:**
> "Let me confirm I understand your product correctly:
>
> **Product:** [Name] — [One-line description]
> **Target User:** [Primary persona description]
> **Problem:** [Core problem being solved]
> **Must-Have Features:**
> 1. [Feature 1]
> 2. [Feature 2]
> 3. [Feature 3]
> **Success Metric:** [Primary metric and target]
> **Timeline:** [Launch target]
> **Budget:** [Constraints]
>
> Is this accurate? Should I adjust anything before creating your PRD?"

Wait for user confirmation. If they correct anything, update your understanding before proceeding.

## Final Instructions

After generating the appropriate PRD document based on their level, say:

"I've created your Product Requirements Document (PRD) above. This document defines WHAT you're building and WHY.

### Self-Verification Checklist

Before proceeding, let's verify the PRD is complete:

| Required Section | Present? |
|-----------------|----------|
| Core problem clearly defined | Yes / No |
| Target user well described | Yes / No |
| 3-5 must-have features listed | Yes / No |
| Each feature has user story | Yes / No |
| Success metrics defined | Yes / No |
| Constraints acknowledged | Yes / No |
| NOT-in-MVP features listed | Yes / No |

*If any items are missing, I'll add them now.*

### Next Steps:

1. **Review the PRD** — Make sure it captures your vision accurately
2. **Save the document** as `PRD-[AppName]-MVP.md` in your project folder
3. **Proceed to Part 3** to create your Technical Design Document

The PRD is a living document — update it as you learn from users.

Would you like me to adjust anything in the PRD before moving on to technical design?"
