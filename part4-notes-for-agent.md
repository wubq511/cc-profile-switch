## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>Generation Rules & Logic</b></summary>

### Your Goal
You are an expert Tech Lead setting up a **Progressive Disclosure** documentation system for an AI Agent. Your output must be **modular** to prevent context window overload.

1. **Master Plan (`AGENTS.md`)**: High-level context, roadmap, and active state.
2. **Detailed Docs (`agent_docs/`)**: Specific implementation details.
3. **Tool Configs**: Concise pointers to the above.

### Content Extraction Guidelines
- **From PRD:** Extract exact feature names, user stories, success metrics, and constraints.
- **From Tech Design:** Extract exact tech stack, architecture decisions, and implementation approaches.
- **Language Level:** Adjust explanations in `agent_docs/` based on user's technical level (A/B/C).
  - **Level A (Vibe-coder):** Explain *concepts* simply, focus on "what to do next".
  - **Level B (Developer):** Focus on *architecture*, patterns, and best practices.
- **Be Specific:** Replace all bracketed placeholders with actual project details.
- **Keep Examples:** Include code examples with comments explaining the "why".

### High-Order Prompts (Meta-Cognition)
Include these behavioral instructions in AGENTS.md to improve agent reasoning:

```markdown
## How I Should Think
1. **Understand Intent First**: Before answering, identify what the user actually needs
2. **Ask If Unsure**: If critical information is missing, ask before proceeding
3. **Plan Before Coding**: Propose a plan, ask for approval, then implement
4. **Verify After Changes**: Run tests/linters or manual checks after each change
5. **Explain Trade-offs**: When recommending something, mention alternatives
```

### Plan → Execute → Verify (Required)
- **Plan:** Outline a brief approach and ask for approval before coding.
- **Plan Mode:** If the tool supports Plan/Reflect mode, use it for this step.
- **Execute:** Implement one feature at a time.
- **Verify:** Run tests/linters or manual checks after each feature; fix before moving on.

### Context & Memory Guidance
- Treat `AGENTS.md` and `agent_docs/` as living docs.
- Use tool config files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/` or legacy `.cursorrules`, etc.) for persistent project rules.
- Update these files as the project scales (commands, conventions, constraints).
- Avoid restarting in empty chats during implementation; summarize/compact first.

### Plugin Support (Recommended)
- If your IDE supports agent plugins, prefer plugin/rules packages over one-off manual setup.
- Verify plugin load status before implementation work.
- If behavior seems wrong: confirm loaded prompts/skills/hooks first, then retry with "Read AGENTS.md first".

### Optional Multi-Agent/Parallel Work
- If the tool supports sub-agents or parallel search, delegate exploration or test checks to speed up work.

### Checkpoints & Pre-Commit Hooks
- Create checkpoints/commits after milestones.
- Use pre-commit hooks to enforce formatting, linting, and tests where applicable.

### Anti-Patterns to Include
Add these to tool configs to prevent common AI mistakes:

```markdown
## What NOT To Do
- Do NOT delete files without explicit confirmation
- Do NOT modify database schemas without backup plan
- Do NOT add features not in the current phase
- Do NOT skip tests for "simple" changes
- Do NOT bypass failing tests or pre-commit hooks
- Do NOT use deprecated libraries or patterns
```

### Strict Anti-Vibe Engineering Rules
For developer-level projects, add these to enforce production quality:

```markdown
## Engineering Constraints

### Type Safety (No Compromises)
- The `any` type is FORBIDDEN—use `unknown` with type guards
- All function parameters and returns must be typed
- Use Zod or similar for runtime validation

### Architectural Sovereignty
- Routes/controllers handle request/response ONLY
- All business logic goes in `services/` or `core/`
- No database calls from route handlers

### Library Governance
- Check existing `package.json` before suggesting new dependencies
- Prefer native APIs over libraries (fetch over axios)
- Avoid deprecated patterns; use the project's standard data-fetching approach (RSC, route loaders, query library, or direct calls — whatever `agent_docs/tech_stack.md` specifies)

### Clear Communication Rule
- State issues briefly and fix them immediately; do not repeat apologies or filler text
- If context is missing, ask ONE specific clarifying question before proceeding

### Workflow Discipline
- Pre-commit hooks must pass before commits (or ask if they should be bypassed)
- If verification fails, fix issues before continuing
```

### "Less is More" for Configs
- Do **NOT** put giant prompt dumps into `CLAUDE.md` or Cursor rules files.
- Instead, put that content into `agent_docs/code_patterns.md` or `agent_docs/tech_stack.md`.
- The config files should merely *point* the AI to the right documentation.

### Model Naming Policy
- Use model family names (Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash) in generated docs unless the user explicitly asks for pinned versions.

</details>

After receiving the files, extract the following:

**From PRD (MUST EXTRACT):**
- Product name and one-line description
- Primary user story (exact text)
- All must-have features (exact list)
- Nice-to-have features (exact list)
- NOT in MVP features (exact list)
- Success metrics (all of them)
- UI/UX requirements (design words/vibe)
- Timeline and constraints

**From Tech Design (MUST EXTRACT):**
- Complete tech stack (frontend, backend, database, deployment)
- Project structure (exact folder layout)
- Database schema (if provided)
- Implementation approach for each feature
- Deployment platform and steps
- Budget constraints
- AI tool recommendations

## 🎯 Action Required: Instantiate the Templates

Your workflow is governed by the `vibe-coding-prompt-template`. This repository comes with a pre-configured `/templates/` directory containing the 2026 Boilerplate. 

Your task is to **copy** these templates to the project root and **fill in the bracketed variables** using the provided PRD and Tech Design. Do not invent new structures.

### 1. Root Files
- Copy `templates/AGENTS.md` to `AGENTS.md` in the root folder. Replace all `[bracketed]` variables with project-specific details from the Tech Design.
- Copy `templates/MEMORY.md` to `MEMORY.md` in the root folder. Initialize the `## 🏗️ Active Phase & Goal` based on the PRD's Phase 1.
- Copy `templates/REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` to the root folder as-is.

### 2. Documentation Folder
- Copy the entire `templates/agent_docs/` folder to `agent_docs/` in the project root.
- Open `agent_docs/tech_stack.md` and insert the explicit languages, frameworks, and setup commands from the Tech Design.
- Open `agent_docs/testing.md` and define the test framework as specified.
- Open `agent_docs/project_brief.md` and insert the vision and core conventions.
- Open `agent_docs/product_requirements.md` and dump the complete feature list and user stories from the PRD.

---

Once completed, you the Agent must stop and say: 
> *"Templates instantiated! You can now start the coding loop. Shall we begin Phase 1?"*
Create a folder named `agent_docs` and add these files. **Fill them with RICH DETAIL from the source documents.**

#### `agent_docs/tech_stack.md`
*Instructions: List every library, version, and setup command from the Tech Design.*
```markdown
# Tech Stack & Tools

1. Open the project in your selected agent-first IDE
2. Ensure GEMINI.md is loaded as context
3. Start with: "Read AGENTS.md and begin"

## Your First Prompts:

Based on your level ([their level]), start with:

**First prompt:**
"[Suggested first prompt based on their level and tool]"

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Show me the current progress"
- "Test [feature name] and fix any issues"
- "Set up pre-commit hooks for lint/tests and keep them updated as the project scales"
- "Make it work on mobile"
- "Add error handling"
- "Deploy to [platform from Tech Design]"

## Success Checklist:

Your setup is complete when:
- [ ] All files saved in correct locations
- [ ] Project folder created
- [ ] AI tool opened and ready
- [ ] First prompt typed and ready to send

## Remember:

- The AI will handle the complex coding
- You guide the direction and test the results
- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Test after each feature
- For frontend projects, require browser-based verification before marking tasks complete
- Run a dedicated security pass before deployment
- Update AGENTS.md and tool configs as the project scales
- Don't hesitate to ask for explanations

**You're ready to build! Your AI assistant has all the context it needs. Just start the conversation and watch your MVP come to life!**

<details>
<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b></summary>

**If AI seems confused:**
- Start with: "First, read AGENTS.md completely, then confirm you understand the project"

**If AI skips steps:**
- Say: "Let's go slower. Implement just [specific feature] and show me how to test it"

**If you get errors:**
- Say: "I got this error: [error]. Please explain what it means and how to fix it"

**If AI overcomplicates:**
- Say: "That seems complex. What's the simplest way to make this work for an MVP?"

</details>

Would you like me to adjust any of the instructions before you start building?"
